## Initial Setup

First need to install packages used with

### `npm install`


## Generate Primes

Will generate prime numbers

Run with

### `node generate_primes.js`

It will keep endlessly generating prime numbers, function isPrime() is meant to be as simple as possible


## Draw Ulam Spiral

Will display famous math art Ulam Spiral in the terminal

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral

Run in iTerm to display picture in terminal

https://iterm2.com/

Then run with

### `node draw_ulam_spiral.js`

## What problem does your project address, and how does it solve it?

Traditionally this work is done in Matlab other science/engineering software, but I choose to use JavaScript and create a simple terminal based app with Node.js (an open source runtime environment)


## AI Models/Technologies Used

None are directly used, but I consulted Grok chatbot in validating the code.  I noticed an error in the AI!  It incorrectly said that a prime number wasn't prime. I think this shows the limitations of AI in that its overhyped and not replacing basic human intelligence.
