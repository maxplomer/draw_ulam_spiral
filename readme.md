## Initial Setup

First need to install packages used with

### `npm install`


## Generate Primes

Will generate prime numbers

Run with

### `node generate_primes.js`

It will keep endlessly generating prime numbers, function isPrime() is meant to be as simple as possible

## What problem does your project address, and how does it solve it?

Traditionally this work is done in Matlab other science/engineering software, but I choose to use JavaScript and create a simple terminal based app with Node.js (an open source runtime environment)
